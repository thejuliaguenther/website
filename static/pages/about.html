<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I graduated from Stanford University with a dual bachelor's degree in Science, Technology, and Society (Innovation, Technology, and Organizations track) and Classics (Latin and Greek languages). Ever since taking my first computer science class in college, I have been passionate about technology's capacity to solve tough problems. Prior to attending Hackbright Academy, I sought to combine my interest in creative problem solving and analytical skills in positions in marketing, customer success, and product strategy. As a software engineer, I hope to work at the cutting edge of innovative technologies and solve large problems at scale. </p>
<br>
<p> As a former Division I varsity athlete, I believe in maximizing free time for self-improvement. Thus, when I'm not coding, I enjoy running training for and racing half and full marathons, reading non-fiction, attending intellectualy stimulating talks, and doing yoga.<p>
